# 🕹️ Simple Web Games Collection

A repository for a collection of simple, web-based games built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal is to create small, fun, and classic games that are easy to play and understand.

## 🚀 Getting Started

All games are designed to be played directly in a modern web browser.

### Playing a Game

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to a Game Directory:**
    Each game resides in its own folder (e.g., `pong/`, `tictactoe/`).
    ```bash
    cd YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME/GAME_NAME
    ```
3.  **Open the Index File:**
    Locate the `index.html` file within the game's directory and open it with your web browser.
